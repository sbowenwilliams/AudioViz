    Make behaviour trees in JavaScript<br/>
    v1.1 <a href="/changelog.txt">changelog</a><br/>

    <h2>What is this library?</h2>
    <p>
      Machine.js lets you use a hierarchical state machine to control a JavaScript object.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. Define a behaviour tree as JSON.
    </p>

    <pre><code>{
    identifier: "idle", strategy: "prioritised",
    children: [
        {
            identifier: "photosynthesise", strategy: "sequential",
            children: [
                { identifier: "makeEnergy" },
                { identifier: "grow" },
                { identifier: "emitOxygen" },
            ]
        },
        { identifier: "gatherSun" },
        { identifier: "gatherWater" },
    ]
};    </code></pre>

    <p>
      2. For each leaf state, define a function that enacts the behaviour for that state.
      So, for the <code>gatherSun</code> state, define a function that gathers sun.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. For each state, define a can function that returns true if the
      actor may move to that state.  So, for the <code>gatherSun</code> state,
      define a function <code>canGatherSun</code> that returns true if the sun is out.
    </p>

      An oak tree absorbs water and sunlight, makes energy and grows.

    <h2>Tutorial</h2>

    <h3>1. A primer on behaviour trees</h3>

    <p>
      A behaviour tree is a normal state machine, except the states are connected in
      a hierarchical structure.  At fork states, the actor controlled by the tree does
      nothing.  A fork state simply leads into one of a set of subsequent states (its
      children).  At leaf states - states with no children - action is taken by the actor.
    </p>

    <p>
      Movement from state to state is controlled by two mechanisms: strategies
      and can functions.
      Each fork state has a strategy that determines which child state to move to.
      Each state has a can function that returns true if the actor is allowed to move to
      that state.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Import libraries</h3>
    <p>
      You will need to import machine.js and base.js.  If you are running your behaviour tree in
      a web page, you might do that like this:

      <script src="https://gist.github.com/991347.js?file=import.js"></script>
    </p>

    <h3>3. Define an actor</h3>
    <p>
      This is the object that will be controlled by the behaviour tree.
      Any normal JavaScript object will do.
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/991347.js?file=landscape.js"></script>

    <h3>4. Write a behaviour tree</h3>

    <p>
      Write some JSON that defines your actor's behaviour tree.
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/991347.js?file=landscapebehaviour.js"></script>

    <h3>5. Define can and action functions</h3>
    <p>
      For each leaf state in your behaviour tree, define a synonymous function.
      This will be run once when the actor moves to the corresponding state.  For each state
      (leaf or fork),
      also define a function called <code>canNameOfState</code>.  This should return true if
      the actor is allowed to move to the corresponding state.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if your leaf state is called <code>kiss</code>, you would define a
      function
      called <code>kiss</code> that does the kissing, and a function called
      <code>canKiss</code>
      that returns true if kissing is allowed.  Put all these functions into an object:
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/991347.js?file=landscapestates.js"></script>

    <h3>6. Put it all together</h3>
    <p>
      Instantiate your actor.  Make an instance of Machine.  Use the instance of machine
      to generate a behaviour tree, passing in the tree JSON, your actor and the object with all the state functions.  Repeatedly
      call <code>tick()</code> on the current state to get the next state.
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/991347.js?file=alltogether.js"></script>

    <h2>Reference</h2>

    <h3>Syntax of the JSON</h3>
    <p>
      States are defined as JSON hashes.  All must have an <code>identifier</code>
      property that is
      set to the name of the state.  Fork states also have a <code>strategy</code>
      property and a <code>children</code>
      property that is set to a list of subsequent states.
    </p>

    <h3>Can functions</h3>
    <p>
      Each state in the machine has a corresponding can function
      called <code>canNameOfState</code>.
      This returns true if the actor can move to this state.  You can omit
      this function if the state is always permissable.
    </p>

    <h3>Strategies</h3>
    <p>
      Fork states are those that have children.  A fork state has a strategy
      assigned to it that determines which state the machine should subsequently move
      to.  Machine.js supports two strategies:
    </p>

    <h4>Prioritised</h4>

    <p>
      Call the can function of the first child.  If it
      returns true, move to that child state.  If it does not, try the
      next child, and so on.  Once a child has been run, or the final
      child has been tested and returns false, go back to the parent fork state.
    </p>

    <h4>Sequential</h4>

    <p>
      Go through all the child states, executing each one
      for which the corresponding can function returns true.  Once all
      the children have been processed, move back to the parent fork state.
    </p>

    <h3>Warping</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes, you want the actor being controlled by the behaviour tree
      to respond to events.  For example, the player might give a soldier
      orders to return to base.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can do this with <code>warp()</code>.  First, define your
      behaviour tree so that it has a special return to base branch that
      is a direct descendent of the root node:
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/991347.js?file=warpbehaviourtree.js"></script>

    <p>
      Next, define a function on the actor that can be called to invoke the
      return to base order.
      In it, instead of using the <code>tick()</code> function to get the next
      state, you use <code>warp()</code> and pass in the identifier of the
      return to base state:
    </p>

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/991347.js?file=warpusage.js"></script>

    <p>
      A word of warning.  The <code>warp()</code> function is a violation
      of the deterministic beauty of a behaviour tree.  Use it sparingly.
    </p>
