	// [jsfx.js](https://github.com/egonelbre/jsfx) is a "Javascript Sound Effect Generator" library
	// We gonna use it to generate sound for WebAudio.js.
	// It allows to avoid downloading sounds, so gain bandwidth on the server, and
	// reduce latency for the users.
	// It seems to provide sounds like 8bit consoles tho :)
	// It got a nice [editor](http://www.egonelbre.com/js/jsfx/) to rapidely invent
	// new sounds.

	// init webaudio.js library
	var webaudio	= new WebAudio();

	// Here you get the parameters for jsfx.js. They are passed directly to jsfx.js.
	// you can generate them with this [editor](http://www.egonelbre.com/js/jsfx/)
	var lib		= ["saw",0.0000,0.4000,0.0000,0.1640,0.0000,0.1880,20.0000,594.0000,2400.0000,0.5440,0.0000,0.0000,0.0100,0.0003,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.5616,0.0000,0.0000,1.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000];
	// here you create a sound with webaudio.js and generate it with jsfx.js
	// after that ```boing``` is a ```WebAudio.Sound``` so you can play it
	// and do many other things allow by the
	// [Web Audio API](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html).
	// We did a short plugin for that ```webaudio.sound.jsfx.js``` 
	var boing	= webaudio.createSound().generateWithJsfx(lib);

	// Here we create another sound. Once again generater by jsfx.js editor	
	var lib		= ["square",0.0000,0.4000,0.0000,0.3560,0.0000,0.1900,20.0000,358.0000,2400.0000,0.3000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0100,0.0003,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.1810,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,1.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000,0.0000];
	var jump	= webaudio.createSound().generateWithJsfx(lib);

	// here we play the sound.
	boing.play();
	jump.play();

	// as ```boing``` and ```jump``` are declared here, you can open the js-console
	// of your browser, and type ```jump.play()```. Try it! It will work and play
	// the sound. This is nice way to experiment and try the various possibilities
	// of webaudio.js library.
	console.log("try to type 'boing.play()' in the console.");
	console.log("or 'sound = jump.loop(true).play()'");
	console.log("then 'sound.stop()'");
	
	// if you feel like it, a good exercice would be to do a plugin on
	// the random generator in the [editor](http://www.egonelbre.com/js/jsfx/).
	// It is in [jsfxgui.js](https://github.com/egonelbre/jsfx/blob/master/lib/jsfxgui.js)
