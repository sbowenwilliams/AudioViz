1. Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
1. Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
1. Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.
1. Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
1. Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
1. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
1. Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
1. Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
1. Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.
1. Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
1. Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
1. Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
1. Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
1. Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
1. Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
1. Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”.
1. Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
