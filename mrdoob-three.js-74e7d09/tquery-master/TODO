# how can i avoid maintaining threex and this ?

* some funky animation plugins
  * displacement
  * all what is visual
  * tQuery.fx.siren.js
  * tQuery.fx.cloud.js

# webstuff
* do a www.* site on www.tquery.org
* do ghpage === docs/
* do blog.* later
* read about comparison between jQuery/dojo/mootools etc...
  * learn from it
* TODO learning webgl example in tQuery
  * like philogl

# establish relation between tquery and threex
* can i maintained both ?
* do i need to maintinaed both ?
* lots need to be determined
* maybe some predefeined fct names could help:
  * onRender for example. May be exported to other events
* ctor param?
* tunable value ?
* you can change threex too to adapt too
