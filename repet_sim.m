%   REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET): REPET-SIM
%   
%   REPET is a simple method for separating the repeating background (e.g., the accompaniment)
%   from the non-repeating foreground (e.g., the melody) in an audio mixture. 
%   REPET can be generalized to look for similarities instead of periodicities.
%
%   Usage:
%       y = repet_sim(x,fs,par);
%
%   Input(s):
%       x: audio mixture [t samples, k channels]
%       fs: sampling frequency in Hz
%       par: similarity parameters (3 values) (default: [0,1,100])
%            par(1): minimal threshold for the similarity with the repeating frames in [0,1]
%            par(2): minimal distance between repeating frames in seconds
%            par(3): maximal number of repeating frames for the median filter
%
%   Output(s):
%       y: repeating background [t samples, k channels]
%          (the corresponding non-repeating foreground is equal to x-y)
%
%	Example(s):
%       [x,fs,nbits] = wavread('mixture.wav');                              % Read some audio mixture
%       y = repet_sim(x,fs,[0,1,100]);                                      % Derives the repeating background with threshold of 0, distance of 1 second, and number of 100 frames
%       wavwrite(y,fs,nbits,'background.wav');                              % Write the repeating background
%       wavwrite(x-y,fs,nbits,'foreground.wav');                            % Write the corresponding non-repeating foreground
