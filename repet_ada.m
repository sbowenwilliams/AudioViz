%   REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique (REPET): adaptive REPET (thanks Antoine!)
%   
%   REPET is a simple method for separating the repeating background 
%   from the non-repeating foreground in an audio mixture. 
%   REPET can be extended by locally modeling the repetitions.
%   
%   Usage:
%       y = repet_ada(x,fs,per,par);
%
%   Input(s):
%       x: mixture data [t samples, k channels]
%       fs: sampling frequency in Hz
%       per: repeating period range (if two values) 
%            or defined repeating period (if one value) in seconds 
%            (default: [0.8,min(8,seg(1)/3)])
%       par: adaptive parameters (two values) (default: [24,12,7])
%            par(1): adaptive window length in seconds
%            par(2): adaptive step length in seconds
%            par(3): order for the median filter
%
%   Output(s):
%       y: repeating background [t samples, k channels]
%          (the corresponding non-repeating foreground is equal to x-y)
%
%	Example(s):
%       [x,fs,nbits] = wavread('mixture.wav');                              % Read some audio mixture
%       y = repet(x,fs,[0.8,8],[24,12,7]);                                  % Derives the repeating background using windows of 24 seconds, steps of 12 seconds, and order of 7
%       wavwrite(y,fs,nbits,'background.wav');                              % Write the repeating background
%       wavwrite(x-y,fs,nbits,'foreground.wav');                            % Write the corresponding non-repeating foreground
